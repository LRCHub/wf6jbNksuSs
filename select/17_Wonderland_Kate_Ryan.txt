How did you do it
How did you make me fall for you so badly
How did it happen
How come I just gave my heart to you so gladly

You are here in my mind
And nothing else than our love really matters
When you look into my eyes
Touch my skin and pull me close
You give me shivers

Into your wonderland
I'm gonna lose myself
Never gonna find a better place
Always gonna stay in your embrace
Wonderland I'm under your command
Never wanna leave never wanna leave
Wonderland

It's amazing
How you have given life another meaning
Takes me higher
Words can't express the way I'm feeling now

When I'm here in your arms
Nothing else than our love really matters
When you smile at me like that
Touch my face and pull me close
You give me shivers

Wonderland of you

Into your wonderland
I'm gonna lose myself
Never gonna find a better place
Always gonna stay in your embrace
Wonderland I'm under your command
Never wanna leave never wanna leave
Wonderland
