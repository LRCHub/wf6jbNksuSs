Take away this broken heart
Broken metronome you tore apart
Tick-Tacking through my memories or fantasies
You're the rhythm of my fears
I wish I had you

Take away this bleeding hand
Bleeding thorns I brought from No man's land
Colouring my empty life of redder shades
In my foolish dreams that fade
I wish I had you cause you're

Alice in Wonderland
Dancing away in slow motion
Alice in Wonderland
Fooling away with time
Cause you live in between the rhyme
Of my rainbow tales

Take away this old man there
Put him in a place where he won't scare
Poor innocent passers-by
His wrinkled face
Has lived through thousand fairy tales
He knows all of you cause you're

Alice in Wonderland
Dancing away in slow motion
Alice in Wonderland
Fooling away with time
Cause you live in between the rhyme
Of my rainbow tales
Of my rainbow tales

Will I remember your face?
And in the morning
Will I remember your smile?
Through out the fantasy
September rain is here and all I know
Is that you're gone now

Alice in Wonderland
Dancing away in slow motion
Alice in Wonderland
Fooling away with time
Cause you live in between the rhyme
Of my rainbow tales

Alice in Wonderland
Dancing away in slow motion
Alice in Wonderland
Fooling away with time
Cause you live in between the rhyme
Of my rainbow tales
Of my rainbow tales
