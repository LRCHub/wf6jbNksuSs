Take me into your heart
Take me into your soul
Take me into the wonderland
Take the rest of me boy
Take all that you need
Take me to the wonderland

Fly away before the time, it's up to you
Run away from the hate, you take with you
Call me now, I will free you from the curse
Here we are, take me to the paradise
